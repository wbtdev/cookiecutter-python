# cookiecutter-python

Originally based on the Cruft template by Timothy Crosley -
Modified to do what I need to do.

A simple template for my own personal Python3.6+ projects utilizing black + isort + flake8 + poetry + mypy + bandit + bugbear + more goodness. Best used with [cruft](https://timothycrosley.github.io/cruft/)

To use:
